            <p>Lisa Miles grew up in a Suzuki environment, taught by well-known instructors in the Pacific Northwest and at Suzuki Institutes by the founding teachers of Suzuki in the Americas.</p>
            <p>In 1986, she received teacher training from Lesa Longay and began teaching violin, going to Oregon State for music education. She followed this with Montessori training, and studying music performance at BSU. Lisa continued S.A.A. Teacher Training from Yuko Honda, one of Suzuki sensei's original students and member of the tour group that spread Suzuki around the world.</p>

            <p>She created a successful music program in Juneau, Alaska for 16+ years one of the Suzuki programs she's built in three states. HeartStrings has had cello, violin and viola students, ages 4-18, playing both Suzuki literature, fiddle tunes and Alaska Folk Festival performances, traditional classical solos and learing theory. Service concerts and creating scholarship programs like the Crescendo Fund were always a part of the HeartStrings mission and approach.</p>
            <p>The need for distance education in Alaska meant learning how to offer online lessons nearly a decade ago. This experience has come in very handy and valuable to make online lessons today successful!</p>

            <p>With a well-rounded experience in education, in addition to teaching music at a public charter school, she ran a Montessori school and wove Suzuki violin into the Montessori environment, and taught homeschool for all 13 years. Many of her students have gone on to become professional musicians or have chosen the path of being a Suzuki Violin Teacher.</p>
            <p>Lisa believes in teaching the whole child, and that love for children extends to their family, friends, pets, and all the things in the child’s world. Her love for humanity inspires a continued life-long dedication to personal growth, child development, education, music, service and community building, and Suzuki’s philosophies that have positively impacted so many.</p>
